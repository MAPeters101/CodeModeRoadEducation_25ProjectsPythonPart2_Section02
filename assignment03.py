# Main game loop


  #first ask the user if they want to increase the count, reset the           count, or stop the count


  #then use conditionals to call the appropriate function based on user's     input


      # End the game if the player types 'stop' (HINT: just break)


  #if the user didn't enter 'increase', 'reset', or 'stop', print that         their input was not valid (HINT: simply just use an else statement)


  #at the end of each loop, print the current count value


#outside of the loop, print the final count value



print("Thanks for playing the game!")
